## üêõ Common Issues and Solutions

### Issue: "My blog post doesn't appear after creating it"

This is the most common issue. Here are the steps to troubleshoot:

#### **Step 1: Check Post Status**
- When creating a post, make sure you click **"Publish"** not just "Save as Draft"
- Only published posts appear on the main blog page (`/blog`)
- Draft posts only appear in the admin area (`/admin/posts`)

#### **Step 2: Verify Post Creation**
1. Go to `/admin/posts` to see all posts (drafts and published)
2. Look for your new post in the list
3. Check the status column - it should say "published"
4. If it says "draft", click the edit button and publish it

#### **Step 3: Check Browser Console**
1. Open browser developer tools (F12)
2. Go to Console tab
3. Create a new post and look for these messages:
   ```
   Creating new post: {title: "Your Title", status: "published", ...}
   Post status: published
   Updated posts array: [...]
   ```

#### **Step 4: Clear Browser Storage**
If posts still don't appear:
1. Open browser developer tools (F12)
2. Go to Application tab ‚Üí Storage ‚Üí Local Storage
3. Find `hesed-blog-storage` and delete it
4. Refresh the page
5. Try creating a new post

#### **Step 5: Force Refresh**
- Press `Ctrl+F5` (Windows) or `Cmd+Shift+R` (Mac) to hard refresh
- Or click the refresh button in the admin posts page

## üîç Debugging Steps

### Check Blog Store State
Open browser console and run:
```javascript
// Check all posts in store
console.log('All posts:', JSON.parse(localStorage.getItem('hesed-blog-storage')));

// Check published posts
window.useBlogStore.getState().getPublishedPosts();
```

### Verify Post Data Structure
A valid blog post should have:
```javascript
{
  id: "unique-id",
  title: "Post Title",
  slug: "post-title",
  excerpt: "Post excerpt",
  content: "Post content",
  status: "published", // Important!
  publishedAt: "2024-01-01T00:00:00.000Z",
  categories: ["Category Name"],
  tags: ["tag1", "tag2"],
  author: {
    name: "Author Name",
    avatar: "/path/to/avatar.jpg"
  },
  featuredImage: "/path/to/image.jpg"
}
```

## üö® Emergency Fixes

### Reset Blog Data
If everything is broken, reset the blog data:
```javascript
// In browser console
localStorage.removeItem('hesed-blog-storage');
window.location.reload();
```

### Add Test Post Manually
```javascript
// In browser console
const testPost = {
  id: Date.now(),
  title: "Test Post",
  slug: "test-post",
  excerpt: "This is a test post",
  content: "<p>This is test content</p>",
  status: "published",
  publishedAt: new Date().toISOString(),
  categories: ["Sermons"],
  tags: ["test"],
  author: {
    name: "Admin User",
    avatar: "/images/avatars/user-01.jpg"
  },
  featuredImage: "/images/sample-image.jpg"
};

// Add to store
window.useBlogStore.getState().createPost(testPost);
```

## üîß Technical Issues

### Issue: Posts disappear after page refresh
**Solution**: This was fixed with localStorage persistence. If it still happens:
1. Check if `zustand/middleware` is properly imported
2. Verify the persist configuration in `blogStore.js`

### Issue: Form validation errors
**Solution**: Make sure all required fields are filled:
- Title: Must not be empty
- Excerpt: Must not be empty  
- Content: Must not be empty
- Categories: At least one must be selected

### Issue: Images not loading
**Solution**: 
- Use full URLs for featured images (e.g., `https://example.com/image.jpg`)
- Or use relative paths to images in the `public` folder (e.g., `/images/sample-image.jpg`)
